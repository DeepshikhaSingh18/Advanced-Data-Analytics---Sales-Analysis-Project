# Advanced-Data-Analytics---Sales-Analysis-Project

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end SQL Data Analysis workflow, simulating how a data analyst would approach a real-world business problem.
The dataset was analyzed using SQL queries to extract insights related to sales, customers, and products.

The project covers time-series analysis, cumulative trends, performance comparisons, part-to-whole breakdowns, segmentation, and reporting, making it an excellent portfolio piece for showcasing SQL skills.
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

SQL (MS SQL Server)
GitHub for version control and project documentation
Dataset: Orders and transactions data (sales, customers, products)
## üìä Analyses Performed
### 1. Changes Over Time
  - Analyzed sales and customer growth across months/years.
  - Identified upward and downward trends.
2. Cumulative Analysis

### 2. Calculated running totals of revenue and customers.
  - Tracked business growth trajectory
### 3. Performance Analysis
  -Compared performance by region, category, and product line.
  - Highlighted top-performing areas.
### 4. Part-to-Whole Analysis
  - Calculated percentage contribution of each category/customer to total revenue.
### 5. Data Segmentation
  - Segmented customers into groups (High Value, Medium Value, Low Value).
  - Helped identify priority customers.
### 6. Customer Report
  Built a report including:
    - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
    - Average Order Value (AOV)
    - Repeat purchases
### 7. Product Report
  Built a report covering:
    - Best-selling products
    - Seasonal trends
    - Profit contribution by category
## üìà Key Insights
Revenue Growth: Consistent upward trend in total sales over time.
Top Categories: Certain product categories contributed disproportionately to total revenue.
Customer Segments: ~20% of high-value customers generated ~60% of revenue (Pareto principle).
Product Performance: A small subset of products drove the majority of sales.

## üìå Future Improvements
Automate reports using Power BI / Tableau dashboards.
Extend analysis with predictive models (e.g., customer churn).
Add stored procedures & optimized queries for large-scale datasets.
